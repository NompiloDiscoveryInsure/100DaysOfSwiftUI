//Swift gives us a special solution called a property wrapper: a special attribute we can place before our properties that effectively gives them super-powers. In the case of storing simple program state like the number of times a button was tapped, we can use a property wrapper from SwiftUI called @State. @State allows us to work around the limitation of structs: we know we canâ€™t change their properties because structs are fixed, but @State allows that value to be stored separately by SwiftUI in a place that can be modified.

struct CounterView: View {
    @State var tapCount = 0
    
    var body: some View {
        Button("Tap Count: \(tapCount)") {
            self.tapCount += 1
        }
    }
}


#Preview {
    CounterView()
}
